                    I am early in Aruppukottai watching the municipal town wake up. The lanes and by-lanes are silent with few women drawing the traditional kolams in front of their houses. The road that cuts across the main market is still in slumber. 
                    Few workers have arrived to clear the previous day‚Äôs garbage. Some are sprinkling water on the dust-laden streets. An odd-vehicle passes by. 
                    Stray dogs and cattle amble along. Only the small eateries are out with their ‚Äútiffin ready‚Äù boards. The bus stand has its usual element of buzz.

                <h3>1.Virudhunagar Ennai Parotta, Veechu parotta, Vegetable Chalna from Tamil Nadu</h3>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OUJTiptaFqQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="parotta" width="500px"/> 

                <p>Exactly a year ago, I read this article on The Hindu - In Search of Virudhunagar Ennai Parotta", the pictures were so sinfully tempting! I have lived all my life in Tamil Nadu and still, this one was new for me. As expected I was taken in so much that I wanted to rush in right away to make these. I was however not able to make these and it looks like it has taken me a year to finally share this.

                Of course, this was one of the first posts I made for the Indian States. Parottas are flaky, layered Indian Bread mostly made popular by the roadside shops that you find all over Tamil Nadu. It's really such wonderful art to see a parotta master flipping the parottas in the air and swirl it to a rope and quickly gathering it as a ball and pressing it down as a roti. The parottas are made with All-purpose flour, with loads of oil, and rested for over hours to get that crispy, flaky texture. There are quite a few varieties to the parottas.

                The regular layered parotta is prepared by just swirling in the air, gathering the pleats, and pressing as small discs. Veechu parotta is made with the same dough, the technique varies, wherein the rolled out disc is swirled in the air, which gains momentum and becomes very thin. The layers are gathered and folded as an envelope. These are famous in Madurai, a city in TN.

                 The Virudhunaga Parottas are made as to the regular parottas but are deep-fried in oil.

                 Regular Parottas, which I make a bit more healthy by adding in the Wheat flour, is a regular dish made at home along with Paneer Butter Masala and is a favorite with my kids. In fact, only on rare occasions, do I end up making Parottas with only All-purpose flour, not because it is not healthy, but because I mostly don't have time to get it soaking for dinner.</p>

                            <p>It is a marriage between two very mundane ingredients ‚Äî milk and sugar ‚Äî and the resultant product is a dish that touches the sweetest note in one‚Äôs taste buds.
                      But for the food aficionados, this treat, called palkova, hits the right spot only if the milk is sourced from the region around Srivilliputhur in south Tamil Nadu. To protect this product that has its origin in the plains that abut the Western Ghats,
                      the Geographical Indication (GI) tag was procured in 2019, thanks to the sustained efforts by the Srivilliputhur Co-operative Primary Milk Producers Society (SCPMPS).rivilliputhur is famous for Pal Kova - a delicious sweet item made from deep boiling of milk,
                      sugar, etc. Srivilliputhur Palkova unique is the traditional method used to prepare it. The milk is not just
                      cooked, but also stirred continuously by hand throughout the process. This technique gives the Palkova is
                     distinctive texture and flavour, which is different from other milk- based sweets. It is also known for its
                     rich, creamy, distinct aroma and mild sweet taste that is not overpowering and melt-in-your-mouth
                     texture. The traditional recipe for Srivilliputhur Palokova does not include any artificial flavours,
                      preservatives, or colours, making it a healthier option compared to other sweets. The Goddess Aandal
                      (The only woman among the 12 Alwar saints) presented this Pal khova to the Great God Vishnu which
                       she prepared on her own in Srivilliputhur, which makes this sweet as one of the Gods own Favorit</p>
