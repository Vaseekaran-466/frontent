                <p><b>The CBI has arrested an assistant accounts officer of the BSF for allegedly taking a bribe of
                        ₹40,000 from a contractor, officials said Saturday (July 19, 2025).</b><br>
                    The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested<span style="color: blue;"> Dharmender Kumar
                        Verma</span>, an Assistant Accounts Officer (AAO) posted with the Border Security Force (BSF),
                    on charges of accepting a bribe from a contractor. Verma was caught red-handed while accepting Rs
                    40,000, part of an alleged<span style="color: rgb(234, 14, 65);"> demand of Rs 2 lakh</span> to
                    facilitate the clearance of pending contractor bills.

                    According to officials, Verma was posted at the Public Accounts Office and had reportedly demanded
                    15 to 20 percent of the total bill amount for processing the payments. The contractor, unwilling to
                    pay the bribe, approached the CBI with a formal complaint.

                    Acting swiftly, the agency set up a trap and apprehended Verma during the transaction on July 18.
                    The investigation is underway to identify other persons potentially involved in the bribery network.

                    A CBI spokesperson confirmed the arrest and stated that further legal proceedings are in progress.

                        India and the United States concluded the fifth round of negotiations for the proposed bilateral
                        trade agreement (BTA) on July 17 in Washington, as both nations intensify efforts to reach an
                        interim deal before August 1. The four-day talks, held from July 14 to 17, were led by Rajesh
                        Agrawal, India’s chief negotiator and Special Secretary in the Department of Commerce.

                        With the 90-day suspension on the Trump-era tariffs (26%) set to expire on August 1, both sides
                        are pushing for consensus on multiple issues. The US had initially imposed steep reciprocal
                        tariffs on several countries, including India, on April 2 this year. This prompted negotiations
                        aiming at tariff revisions and a broader trade agreement

                    <li>
                        Discussions focused on sectors including agriculture, automobiles, and strategic technologies.
                        India reiterated its firm stance on the US request for tariff cuts on agri and dairy products.
                        New Delhi remains cautious, having never offered dairy sector concessions in any trade pact to
                        date. Farmer associations have also raised concerns, urging the government to keep agriculture
                        outside the agreement’s purview.

            CAIRO, July 21 (Reuters) - Israeli tanks pushed into southern and eastern areas of the Gazan city of Deir
            Al-Balah for the first time on Monday, an area where Israeli sources said the military believes some of the
            remaining hostages may be being held.<br>

            Gaza medics said at least three Palestinians were killed and several were wounded in tank shelling that hit
            eight houses and three mosques in the area, and which came a day after the military ordered residents to
            leave, saying it planned to fight Hamas militants.

                <p><b>Díaz had been with Liverpool since 2022 and scored 17 goals in 50 games across all competitions
                        last season</b></p>

                <p>Bayern Munich signed Liverpool winger Luis Díaz to a four-year <br>contract on Wednesday<span
                        style="color: rgb(8, 124, 233);"> (July 30,
                        2025)</span> in the German champion's biggest deal of the offseason so far.</p>
                <p>Sources told ESPN the deal is worth €75 million ($88m), inclusive of add-ons. He becomes Bayern's
                    third signing of the<br> summer following the arrivals of Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah and
                    Hoffenheim
                    midfielder Tom Bischof.

                    "I'm very happy, it means a lot to me to be part of FC Bayern, they're one of the biggest clubs in
                    the world," Díaz said in a statement.<br><br>

                    "I want to help my new team with my way of playing football and my character. My goal is to win
                    every possible title, and that's what we'll work for every day as a team."<br><br>

                    Díaz missed Liverpool's friendly defeat against AC Milan on Saturday due to ongoing speculation
                    linking him with a move away from Anfield and was granted permission to <br>leave the preseason tour
                    of Asia on Sunday.<br><br>

                    Sources told ESPN that Díaz first signalled a wish to leave Liverpool in the summer of 2024 -- with
                    his existing deal due to expire in 2027 -- but the club held firm while assessing both the squad and
                    the market.</p>
